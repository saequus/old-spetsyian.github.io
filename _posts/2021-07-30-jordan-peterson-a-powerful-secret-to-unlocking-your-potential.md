### Following is written answer from Jordan Peterson for a question about unlocking your potential.

We already know from the clinical perspective that if you set up a path towards the goal it provides you with paused emotions because it implies hierarchy. You set up something as valuable, so you pick up something and going to do it instead of other things which becomes a sacrifice because you sacrifice something in pursue of your goal.

You experience yourself in paused emotions and meaning as you observe yourself reaching your goal. The implication is the more valuable and bigger the goal is the richer and more full experience of the goal is going to be when you will have pursued it.

That is one of the reasons for developing vision and for flashing yourself out philosophically because you want to aim at the highest goal that you can manage. On the way towards your goal, you understand a simple idea: accomplish some things that frighten you first to reach it. For example, you have to learn new skills and you are afraid of that because it will stretch you and put you up against challenges.

A behavior therapist might help you with this. What he or she is going to do is to make you do to help you is to __break down the goal into smaller and smaller pieces__ until you find a piece small enough that you can easily do it. 

So that you would not be upset but you get braver as one piece sticks to the other forming a chain of accomplished challenges. Consider yourself doing something new and that is informative as there is information in the action and then you can incorporate that information and turn it into a skill or a transformation of your perceptions. So, there is more to you because you have tried something new.

There is a biological confirmation of the process that __if you put yourself in a new environment then genes code for new proteins and build new neural system structures__.

The same thing happens to some degree when you work out as your muscles respond to the load. The nervous system does that too. Once again, a lot of your potential is locked in the genetic code. If you put yourself in a new situation, the stress produces by that particular situation unlocks those genes and builds a new part of you.

That is cool because you know how much information is encoded in you.
Let's assume that that scales as you take on heavier and heavier loads. As you do more and more difficult things, you get more and more informed, and more and more of you get unlocked.

So, it implies that you get to the point at some moment where you can look at the darkest things. As that would be the deepest abyss like if you would be able to look straight and directly at the harshest things, the most brutal thins among the sufferings of the world, the malevolence of the people and the society. That would turn you on maximally.

That is the idea of rescuing you further as the potential composite of all your ancestors' wisdom locked inside of you biologically. But that is not going to come out at all unless you stress and challenge yourself. And the bigger the challenge you take on, the more that is going to turn on.

So, as you take a broader and broader range of challenges, you push yourself harder. Then what you could turn on is equivalent to transforming yourself into the united ancestor experience further as you are the consequence of all living beings that have come before you.

That's all part of your biological potentiality. 

> If you push yourself to the limit only that just clicks on turning you into what you could be. 

That's the representation of that paused events of ancestors' order.

So, that's why rescue yourself from the belly of the beast.
